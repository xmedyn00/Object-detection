# Object-detection
This work focuses on image processing using the OpenCV library and detecting moving objects 
in video using convolutional neural networks. The resulting application can detect moving objects 
in video or in real time and includes a user interface that allows the user to easily control the application. 
Part of this application is the YOLO convolutional model, which is designed to detect moving objects.
